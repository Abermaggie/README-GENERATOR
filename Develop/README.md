## Description
The subject matter of coding projects can span a wide 'array' of topics and genres but there is one mandatory requirement that can make or break your project: a professional README file.  This file is the face of your project and it informs the client of the issues addressed, their pertinence, and how this project solves that issue. The intricacies of explaining this can become quite tedious and often important additions of necessary materials are lost in the midst of pulling together the copious amounts of information required. 

## Installation
Visit the following sites, select your preferred operating system, and download programs/software using instructions provided.

- VS Studio Code- https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Git Bash- https://git-scm.com/

## Contributing to this Project
Contact the owner/developer Maggie Abernathy via individual contact (information in the questions section) or via comments on the repository you are interested in understanding/collaborating.

## Testing Methods
Current testing methods include terminal testing via Visual Studio Code.

## Road Map
Future Developments:

- Create a more user friendly and functionally interactive inquiry process either instead of or in collaboration with the inquirer.js package.
- Offer several different templates to choose from so that the author doesn't have endure the gambit of questions if they want a concise README.md.
- Offer the ability to upload images and videos straight from an interactive database.
- Allow for direct connection with highly utilized sites (ex. Git Hub, NPM, API's).
